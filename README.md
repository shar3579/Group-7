## Case Study: Ultrasonic Sensor with STM32F401CCU6 and Buzzer
Overview
This case study documents the implementation and demonstration of an embedded system project that utilizes an ultrasonic sensor in conjunction with an STM32F401CCU6 microcontroller and a buzzer. The project showcases how the sensor detects obstacles and triggers an audible alert via the buzzer, making it suitable for applications such as obstacle detection or distance measurement systems.
